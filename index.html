        <h5>About Runner</h5>
        <p>
          Runner App is a lightweight fitness companion that lets you explore a
          list of passionate runners and the company founders who guide them.
          Each runner has their own profile with personal stats like age, blood
          type, running experience, 5km personal record, number of races
          completed, and reviews that highlight their journey. You can view
          details about each runner, get inspired by their progress, and learn
          about the experts behind the fitness company. The app is designed to
          be simple, interactive, and motivating for anyone interested in
          running and fitness.
